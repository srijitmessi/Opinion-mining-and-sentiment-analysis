negative,exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
negative,"[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation ."
negative,a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
negative,"the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count ."
negative,about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .
negative,not so much farcical as sour .
negative,unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
negative,"all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject ."
negative,a sentimental mess that never rings true .
negative,"while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary ."
negative,"interesting , but not compelling ."
negative,"on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire ."
negative,"while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle ."
negative,there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
negative,"nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah ."
negative,"such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us "" the skulls "" and last year's "" rollerball . "" enough said , except : film overboard !"
negative,"here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha ."
negative,this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
negative,the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
negative,"on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation ."
negative,it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .
negative,"a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films ."
negative,"as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma ."
negative,the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .
negative,our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
negative,"the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . ."
negative,"the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here ."
negative,"stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's "" waking up in reno . "" go back to sleep ."
negative,"somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates ."
negative,the action clichés just pile up .
negative,"payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast ."positive,a conventional but heartwarming tale .
positive,a thought-provoking picture .
positive,this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .
positive,"skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor ."
positive,a film of quiet power .
positive,"more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem ."
positive,an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .
positive,the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
positive,"yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it ."

neutral,@WSPSanDiego Kickoff tomorrow 10/20 at San Diego #Microsoft Store at 6:00pm @wspwest ping me w/questions #in
positive,"film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout ."
positive,"o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing ."
positive,"it's still adam sandler , and it's not little nicky . and for many of us , that's good enough ."
positive,here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .
positive,"lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability ."
positive,kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
positive,"it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing"
positive,"while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel ."
positive,"the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun ."
positive,the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d .
positive,"has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre ."
positive,"more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again ."
positive,this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie .
positive,"mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh ."
positive,". . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age ."
positive,"writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza ."
positive,rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .
positive,"holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks ."
positive,"like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll ."
positive,". . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . ."
positive,kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .
positive,"all in all , a great party ."
positive,a moving story of determination and the human spirit .
positive,""" brown sugar "" admirably aspires to be more than another "" best man "" clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film ."
positive,"[gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass ."
positive,a stylish thriller .
positive,an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .
positive,"in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better ."
positive,"though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed ."
positive,"scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf ."
positive,"what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates ."
positive,"the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task ."
positive,"although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense ."
positive,i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute .
positive,"there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it ."
positive,"a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide ."
positive,"this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success ."
positive,like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting .
positive,". . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor ."
positive,coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching .
positive,"the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries ."
positive,"poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter ."
positive,worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .
positive,handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
positive,"a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown ."
positive,"while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem ."
positive,"in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue ."
positive,"we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies ."
positive,"an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century ."
positive,"the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino ."
positive,the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . .
positive,this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .
positive,"this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem ."
positive,"the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in "" last dance "" ] ."
positive,"in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box ."
positive,a very charming and funny movie .
positive,this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
positive,"streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , "" big trouble "" is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter ."
positive,consummate actor barry has done excellent work here .
positive,the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough .
positive,"while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original ."
positive,ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .
positive,"i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that ."
positive,you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
positive,may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country .
positive,"a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness ."
positive,"the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds ."
positive,"cold , nervy and memorable ."
positive,becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters .
positive,spend your benjamins on a matinee .
positive,"all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own ."
positive,worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia .
positive,a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment .
positive,among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations .
positive,"it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought ."
positive,"it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming ."
positive,"the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema ."
positive,there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live .
positive,"cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective ."
positive,"it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously ."
positive,"a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time ."
positive,what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn .
positive,"is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say , yes , 'it's like having an old friend for dinner' ."
positive,writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured .
positive,"insightfully written , delicately performed"
positive,"perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though ."
positive,this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be .
positive,one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .
positive,"a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist ."
positive,an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . .
positive,"between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season ."
positive,"jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting ."
positive,"filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home ."
positive,interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
positive,"a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling ."
positive,"it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film ."
positive,graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world .
positive,"though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess ."
positive,"compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get ."
positive,delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .
positive,"bon appétit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation ."
positive,"the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings ."
positive,"this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards ."
positive,"some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options ."
positive,playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .
positive,a film that will enthrall the whole family .
positive,"the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids ."
positive,k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
positive,it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
positive,"like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining ."
positive,"an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot"
positive,"an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do ."
positive,"nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions ."
positive,"both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others ."
positive,"leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly ."
positive,"in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players ."
positive,"like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season ."
positive,"though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance ."
positive,"y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón"
positive,"what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance ."
positive,just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
positive,probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent .
positive,what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .
positive,a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .
positive,"the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek ."
positive,"É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado ."
positive,"light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat ."
positive,"it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate ."
positive,"massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history ."

negative,. . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
negative,"a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek ."
negative,"shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity ."
negative,imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
negative,"soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself ."
negative,"a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable ."
negative,the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
negative,"it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb ."
negative,"the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script ."
negative,"it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile ."
negative,proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .

negative,"guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs ."
negative,audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
negative,to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .
negative,"it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning ."
negative,credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
negative,"i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve ."
negative,"for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together ."
negative,"an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views ."
negative,"a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison ."

negative,"it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part ."
negative,"this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself ."
negative,". . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle ."
negative,"literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes ."
negative,arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie .
negative,"anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss ."
negative,chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
negative,a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .
negative,unwieldy contraption .
negative,the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
negative,marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
negative,the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
negative,"if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead ."
negative,"so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically ."
negative,this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
negative,"when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper ."
negative,"most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future ."
negative,"the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business ."
negative,you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic !
negative,a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
negative,this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .
negative,"before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon ."
negative,"the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin ."
negative,"instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?"
negative,"a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker ."
negative,"scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be ."
negative,"the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix ."
negative,"flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent ."
negative,a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
negative,the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .
negative,". . . instead go rent "" shakes the clown "" , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance ."
negative,"lame , haphazard teen comedy ."
negative,"it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that ."
negative,"this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through ."
negative,"expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies ."
negative,"nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera ."
negative,"it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us ."
negative,"might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage ."
negative,every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .
negative,arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
negative,both awful and appealing .
negative,the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
negative,nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
negative,"we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting ."
negative,"helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge ."
negative,it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .
negative,i hated every minute of it .
negative,"[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context ."
negative,obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
negative,"there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version ."
negative,"a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within ."
negative,"roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut ."
negative,"there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double ."
negative,anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
negative,"ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive ."
negative,"if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films ."
negative,pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .
negative,"not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies ."
negative,"it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull ."
negative,the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
negative,a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
negative,"director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person ."
negative,"egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious ."

negative,"despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing ."
negative,"shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension ."
negative,plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .

negative,an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
negative,"birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it ."
negative,"de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest ."
negative,even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney .
negative,"that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point ."
negative,a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
negative,"if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be "" how does steven seagal come across these days ? "" or maybe "" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?"
negative,"it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) ."
negative,"the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay ."
negative,you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
negative,"dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick ."
negative,"ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke ."
negative,"flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams ."
negative,little more than a frothy vanity project .
negative,the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
negative,"verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills ."
negative,"for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer ."
negative,the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
negative,"alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl ."
negative,the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
negative,"the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet ."
negative,the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict .
negative,ihops don't pile on this much syrup .
negative,"for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies ."

negative,"the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens ."

negative,. . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .
negative,. . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
negative,. . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
negative,"it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold ."
negative,"it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning ."
negative,largely a for-fans artifact .
negative,"there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity ."
negative,characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
negative,there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .

negative,"[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one ."
negative,so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
negative,"it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through ."
negative,watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
negative,"it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet ."
negative,"there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject ."
negative,"overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper ."
negative,could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .
negative,"i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood ."

negative,"human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control ."
negative,"[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy ."
negative,not even the hanson brothers can save it
negative,"the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case ."
negative,. . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
negative,"a sour , nasty offering ."
negative,"feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk ."

negative,it tells more than it shows .
negative,earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
negative,"the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles ."
negative,pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
negative,"not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school "" cartoon "" ."
negative,"do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor ."
negative,"nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them ."
negative,much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
negative,this is really just another genre picture .
negative,"each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception ."
negative,"william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . ."

negative,"'carente de imaginación , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance , es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'"
negative,"acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes "" never again "" worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice"
negative,"both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie ."
negative,""" collateral damage "" goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief"
negative,'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances .
negative,"a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle ."
negative,"i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't ."
negative,"as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell ."
negative,"like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten ."
negative,"the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do ."
negative,"just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination ."
negative,"there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false ."
negative,"where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines ."
negative,"why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ?"
negative,"a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags ."
negative,. . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
negative,"lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose ."
negative,"though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work ."
negative,"perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about ."
negative,"wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn ."
negative,somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
negative,this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
negative,"is "" ballistic "" worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer ."
negative,"the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them ."
negative,"sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution ."
negative,"kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world ."

negative,the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
negative,this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
negative,a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
negative,"any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors ."
negative,"it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled ."
negative,"debut effort by "" project greenlight "" winner is sappy and amateurish ."
negative,one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .
negative,"the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp ."
negative,"the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs ."
negative,"the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies ."
negative,"purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too ."
negative,. . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
negative,"though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected ."
negative,well-made but mush-hearted .
negative,humor in i spy is so anemic .
negative,the film is strictly routine .
negative,a real snooze .
negative,"skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions ."
negative,"while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier ."
negative,"in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase ."
negative,"it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between ."
negative,"the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down ."
negative,you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
negative,barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
negative,"if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid ."
negative,we get the comedy we settle for .
negative,the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
negative,two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .

negative,the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
negative,cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
negative,"manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new ."
negative,"hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing ."
negative,"true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at ."
negative,doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .
negative,the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
negative,kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
negative,"the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due ."
negative,queen of the damned is too long with too little going on .
negative,it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush .
negative,"any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss ."
negative,". . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves ."
negative,the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
negative,"though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful ."
negative,"in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian ."
negative,feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
negative,no surprises .
negative,"you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal ."
negative,"the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view ."
negative,this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
negative,characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
negative,"the venezuelans say things like "" si , pretty much "" and "" por favor , go home "" when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of "" dragonfly . """
negative,"it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will ."
negative,director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
negative,"it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 ."
negative,"like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on"
negative,as pedestrian as they come .
negative,a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
negative,"it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary ."
negative,"put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work ."
negative,more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
negative,"an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle ."
negative,"the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here ."
negative,as saccharine as it is disposable .
negative,"you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another ."
negative,"the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery ."
negative,"very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all ."
negative,"too much power , not enough puff ."
negative,the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
negative,"it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances ."
negative,"a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential ."
negative,"muddled , trashy and incompetent"
negative,"for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league ."
negative,narc is all menace and atmosphere .
negative,"though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore ."
negative,"despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs ."
negative,it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing .
negative,"his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it ."
negative,it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
negative,a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
negative,there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .
negative,"as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction ."
negative,the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
negative,"enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid ."
